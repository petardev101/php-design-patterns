# Template Method Pattern

A Behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in a method, called template method, which defers 
some steps to subclasses.

Extract a lot of the behavior/functionality to an abstract class, but when it comes to specific differences, we defer to a subclass.
